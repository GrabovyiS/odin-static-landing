Not adaptive landing page for practicing making layouts with flexbox, part of The Odin Project Foundations course.

Not having a robust system for naming things in CSS is frustrating. I doubted and changed class names and doubted class selectors for every little thing in general. This way of doing CSS is not scalable and frustrating. Want to get to proper methodology, to components, to the way people in the real world write CSS.

Nice to know that the things, that The Odin Project teaches in the Foundations are very much applicable. Pleasant to actually make something from an empty folder on a pc, from scratch and to end up with a visible webpage (even hosted by Github).
